# Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Description
This project is a simple **Disease Prediction System** developed as a mini project using basic machine learning concepts.  
The goal of the project is to predict a possible disease based on the symptoms entered by the user.

The system is trained using a dataset that contains various symptoms and their related diseases.  
Based on the input symptoms, the model analyzes patterns from the data and provides a prediction.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python for backend and prediction logic  
- HTML for a simple user interface  
- CSV files for training and testing data  
- Basic Machine Learning concepts  
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user selects or enters symptoms using the HTML page.
2. These symptoms are passed to the Python program.
3. The program processes the input using the trained dataset.
4. The system predicts the most likely disease.
5. The result is shown to the user.
